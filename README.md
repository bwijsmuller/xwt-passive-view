# xwt-passive-view

This is a library with basic set of helper classes that allow for Model-View-Presenter based programming with SWT.
It uses XWT to have screen layout defined in xml.
It relies on some form of dependency injection, it provides a simple static factory helper for it.

Using this setup all interaction with the view can be easily unit tested.
